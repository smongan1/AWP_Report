Prior to moving to the SC upstate I lived in Florida where I reached out to several of the large veteran organizations with zero results or follow up other than a form email response.  I had given up on veteran assistance and programs until I gave UWS what I believed was my last effort.  Since then Tyler Warren and Chad Wooten have been the best connections and most responsive people I have ever reached out to.  I know that bettering my situation will require more than 80% effort on my part and they will reach out when I show the effort.  They have done precisely that, I was connected with Operis Workforce and Scott Smart and have obtained two interviews in that short time.  I can not ask for more support.  Your organization should be nation wide, there are so many of us suffering in silence and believing that we are totally alone in this endeavor.  The pressure to support our families is so heavy the weight manifests itself physically.  Thank you|

Eventually, I was passed off to the WWP rep that was in your office that day. Even though my claim was settled, I was not happy with the follow-up or follow-through of the rep I was given.  After that initial meeting, he was hard to get a hold of and when I did reach him, he told me to use the online VA service. After my claim was resolved, I needed to apply for the automobile grant. My rep told me to look up and complete the application online myself.  I have not asked for nor will I ask for anymore help from either organization.||||||

It's impossible to meet with my vrc counselor and I've complained to everyone there. Unfortunately cannot get past the rent a cop at the front with out an appointment so it's impossible to walk in. VRC counselor dropped me from my program after failing to reach out and tell me she was going to do so. I had been emailing and calling to reach her but never received any response from her or supervisors. The monthly JT schmids business event is a waste of time. Its not informative and everyone there seemed to be trying to either sell something or talk about themselves. I was hoping to either find leads for an internship or an internship instead I found a bunch of middle aged men who just wanted to talk about themselves and pay for overpriced drinks.

There needs to be advocates for educational benefits for children of veterans. I was in the National Guard for over 17 years and it seems no one wants to help. These organizations only want to help the disabled or active duty which is wrong. I spent time in Iraq too and have a good military record. You people should try and help everyone, not just the ones you can get a return on. My apologies for being blunt but it's truly how I see it.|
