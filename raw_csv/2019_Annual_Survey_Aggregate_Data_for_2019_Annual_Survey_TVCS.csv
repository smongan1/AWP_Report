VRC counselor dropped me from my program after failing to reach out and tell me she was going to do so. I had been emailing and calling to reach her but never received any response from her or supervisors. The monthly JT schmids business event is a waste of time. Its not informative and everyone there seemed to be trying to either sell something or talk about themselves. I was hoping to either find leads for an internship or an internship instead I found a bunch of middle aged men who just wanted to talk about themselves and pay for overpriced drinks.||||
