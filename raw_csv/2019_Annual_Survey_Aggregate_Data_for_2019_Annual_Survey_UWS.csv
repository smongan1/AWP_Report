Prior to moving to the SC upstate I lived in Florida where I reached out to several of the large veteran organizations with zero results or follow up other than a form email response.  I had given up on veteran assistance and programs until I gave UWS what I believed was my last effort.  Since then Tyler Warren and Chad Wooten have been the best connections and most responsive people I have ever reached out to.  I know that bettering my situation will require more than 80% effort on my part and they will reach out when I show the effort.  They have done precisely that, I was connected with Operis Workforce and Scott Smart and have obtained two interviews in that short time.  I can not ask for more support.  Your organization should be nation wide, there are so many of us suffering in silence and believing that we are totally alone in this endeavor.  The pressure to support our families is so heavy the weight manifests itself physically.  Thank you||
