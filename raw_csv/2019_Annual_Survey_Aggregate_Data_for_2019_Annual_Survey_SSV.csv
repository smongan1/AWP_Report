There needs to be advocates for educational benefits for children of veterans. I was in the National Guard for over 17 years and it seems no one wants to help. These organizations only want to help the disabled or active duty which is wrong. I spent time in Iraq too and have a good military record. You people should try and help everyone, not just the ones you can get a return on. My apologies for being blunt but it's truly how I see it.||
