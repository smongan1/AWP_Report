Eventually, I was passed off to the WWP rep that was in your office that day. Even though my claim was settled, I was not happy with the follow-up or follow-through of the rep I was given.  After that initial meeting, he was hard to get a hold of and when I did reach him, he told me to use the online VA service. After my claim was resolved, I needed to apply for the automobile grant. My rep told me to look up and complete the application online myself.  I have not asked for nor will I ask for anymore help from either organization.||
