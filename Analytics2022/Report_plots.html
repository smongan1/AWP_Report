    <p>
     <b>
      Our mission is to partner with communities to prevent veteran suicide. Our programs accomplish this by starting at the community level and understanding the unique situations of veterans and their families. We connect local veteran-serving organizations with the appropriate resources, services, and partners that they need to support veterans, their families, and caregivers at every stage of veteransâ€™ lives. Our ultimate goal is to improve the quality of life for veterans and to end veteran suicide by empowering local communities to serve them proactively and holistically before a crisis occurs.

 

Our upstream approach to veteran empowerment is a four-step plan to Connect, Educate, Advocate, and Collaborate with veterans, their families, caregivers, and the communities that support them.

One way to assess the overall attitude of a veteran is through the Hope Scale Score. This score ta
